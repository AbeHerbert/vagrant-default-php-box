vagrant-default-php-box
=======================

This box installs Ubuntu with Apache2.2, PHP5.3, MySQL5.5, PHPMyAdmin, Sass and Compass.
For example you can use it to run Symfony2, Joomla, Wordpress or any other system you would like.

Sidenotes:
Once using ```vagrant up``` or ```vagrant provision``` you might see output, telling ```stdin: is not a tty```. 
There is no need to worry about this notice. This is telling you that the current tty is not interactive.
